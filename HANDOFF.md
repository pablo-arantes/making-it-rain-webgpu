# Where this left off

`AGENTS.md` has the invariants and `CLAUDE.md` the durable findings. This file
has only what is **unfinished**.

## State

**Phase 0 is done. Phase 1 is underway**, through the first of its six steps.

`npm run check` passes: typecheck, 45 unit and reference tests, web build.
`npm run test:browser` passes all five device checks plus the bonded-force
comparison on both fixtures. `npm run bench` and `npm run report:adapter` work
and their output is committed under `docs/measurements/`.

Done in Phase 1 so far:

- **`System` and `State` parsers** (`src/engine/system.ts`, `state.ts`, over a
  purpose-built scanner in `xml.ts`): 7.5 MB of `system.xml` in 39 ms, every
  force type this workflow produces, with an explicit named error for anything
  else.
- **Bonded forces**, reference and WGSL: energies match OpenMM to between
  1.7e-8 and 1.6e-6 relative on both fixtures, forces to between 5.6e-7 and
  7.1e-6 relative RMS.
- **Direct-space Ewald and Lennard-Jones**, reference and WGSL, including the
  exclusion corrections, the exceptions, and the analytic dispersion
  correction. On the GPU: 1.05e-7 energy agreement with OpenMM on 1L2Y and
  **3.93e-7 on 3HTB's 26,749 atoms**, where +1.67e6 kJ/mol of exclusion
  corrections nearly cancel against a +1.56e6 total.
- **Reciprocal-space PME**, reference and WGSL: order-5 B-spline spreading, a
  mixed-radix Stockham FFT over radices 2/3/5/7, the convolution and
  interpolated forces. On the GPU, 1.23e-8 energy agreement with OpenMM on
  1L2Y's 25³ mesh and 1.36e-7 on 3HTB's 54³. The transform has its own
  differential test against the f64 reference, which is itself checked against a
  direct O(n²) transform.
- **Every force term of the notebook's `System` now runs on the GPU** and
  agrees with OpenMM.
- **erf and erfc**, f64 for the reference and a rational approximation for the
  kernel, the latter measured at < 1.2e-7 relative over the whole Ewald range.
- **The nonbonded decomposition, measured and written down** in
  `docs/NONBONDED.md`. Three terms are not what a first reading suggests, and
  each is larger than the total energy or would have silently biased it.
- **Constraints: SHAKE and RATTLE, reference only**, matching OpenMM's
  algorithm including its simultaneous (Jacobi) delta application. Agrees with
  `Context.applyConstraints` to 1.8e-7 nm on 1L2Y and 6.2e-7 on 3HTB, which is
  the width of the tolerance band.
- **Two deterministic trajectory oracles**, velocity Verlet and LFMiddle at
  zero friction, with `tools/capture_constraints.py`. The integrator and
  constraint algorithms, and four things a first reading gets wrong about them,
  are in `docs/DYNAMICS.md`.

Phase 1 steps still to do: the **constraint kernel** (the reference is done,
and the measured cluster shapes -- at most 4 atoms and 3 constraints -- mean one
thread can hold a whole cluster), the **integrators** (LFMiddle for production
and velocity Verlet for the NVE gate, both with reference implementations still
to write), the **barostat**, and the **minimiser**. After those, Phase 1's
gates: NVE drift at 2 fs, and a measured ns/day.

## Open, in the order they are worth doing

### The FFT is correct but not yet tuned
Radices 2, 3, 5 and 7, with a generic R² inner product per butterfly rather
than specialised butterflies — at most 49 terms, since the radix is at most 7.
Specialised radix-2/3/4/5 butterflies and a radix-4 or radix-8 path for
power-of-two sizes are the obvious next step, and the differential test in
`src/gpu/checks.ts` is what they would be held to. **Measure before writing
them**: the per-step cost of PME against everything else is not known yet,
because there is no step loop to measure.

### The NVE gate cannot use the notebook's integrator
LFMiddle at zero friction is symplectic Euler, so its naive total energy
oscillates at O(dt) rather than drifting -- measured at ±0.02 kJ/mol an atom on
1L2Y at 2 fs, against 3e-4 for velocity Verlet. The drift gate therefore runs
velocity Verlet, which is what `tools/calibrate_thresholds.py` already used.
That means the engine ships **two** integrators, and LFMiddle's own correctness
is gated on step-by-step determinism rather than on energy conservation.
`docs/DYNAMICS.md` has the numbers.

### The acceptance thresholds are provisional
`AGENTS.md` quotes OpenCL **single** precision on an Apple M3 Pro, because this
machine's OpenMM has no mixed-precision GPU platform. Phase 1's gates need the
real thing: `tools/calibrate_thresholds.py` on the **Colab T4**, for 1L2Y, 3HTB
and DHFR. Pablo has agreed to run it. Until then every Phase 1 threshold is a
placeholder with a plausible value, which is the worst kind.

### Whether the nonbonded kernel gathers or scatters
Settled for determinism, open for speed. An atomic scatter is bit-reproducible
because the accumulation is integer, so gather is now a pure performance
question — and on Apple the atomics are cheap (374 M adds/s into one contended
slot, *faster* than 65536 uncontended ones, so scattered memory costs more than
contention). Measure both on NVIDIA and on an integrated adapter before
committing the nonbonded kernel either way.

### The oracle lane has no oracle
`npm run test:oracle` reports `vendor/openmm-wasm/openmm.wasm` missing and skips.
Building it is Phase 1 work, from the recipe in `docs/PRIOR_ART.md` §1 — OpenMM
8.2, Emscripten, Reference platform only, no pthreads, plus the serial-CCMA
patch without which a constrained `Context` deadlocks in the browser. About
906 KB when built. It is the acceptance reference for every force kernel *and*
the "verify this system" button, so it is worth doing early rather than late.

### Dawn does not load on this machine
`npm run test:gpu` cannot run on macOS 14 — every published binary wants
macOS 15+. The browser lane covers it, and CI runs Dawn on Linux, so this is
recorded rather than blocking. It will resolve itself on a macOS upgrade.

### Smaller
* `src/gpu/compute.ts` allocates buffers directly. `AGENTS.md` requires every
  allocation to go through one place so peak memory stays measurable; there is
  nothing to pool yet, and Phase 1 must replace it before the force kernels
  land.
* The three CI jobs other than `check` are `continue-on-error: true`, because
  none has been run on a hosted runner yet. Tighten each as it proves itself;
  leaving them permanently soft would make them decorative.

## Next

Phase 1, in the order the plan gives: `System`/`State` parser, then the
TypeScript double-precision reference, then WGSL bonded → direct space with
exceptions → PME reciprocal → constraints → integrator → barostat, each against
the committed fixtures.
